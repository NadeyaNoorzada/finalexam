        <p>보란 듯이 무너졌어<br>
          바닥을 뚫고 저 지하까지<br>
          옷 끝자락 잡겠다고<br>
          저 높이 두 손을 뻗어 봐도<br>
          다시 캄캄한 이곳에 light up the sky <br>
          네 두 눈을 보며, I'll kiss you goodbye <br>
          실컷 비웃어라 꼴 좋으니까 <br>
          이제 너희, 하나, 둘, 셋<br>
          Ha, how you like that?<br>
          You gon' like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that<br>
          How you like that? (Bada-bing, bada-boom-boom-boom)<br>
          How you like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that?<br>
          Now look at you, now look at me, look at you, now look at me<br>
          Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?<br>
          Now look at you, now look at me, look at you, now look at me<br>
          Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?<br>
          Your girl need it all and that's a hunnid<br>
          백 개 중에 백, 내 몫을 원해<br>
          Karma come and get some<br>
          딱하지만 어쩔 수 없잖아<br>
          What's up? I'm right back (right back)<br>
          방아쇠를 cock back (cock back)<br>
          Plain Jane get hijacked, don't like me?<br>
          Then tell me how you like that, like that<br>
          더 캄캄한 이곳에 shine like the stars<br>
          그 미소를 띠며, I'll kiss you goodbye<br>
          실컷 비웃어라 꼴 좋으니까<br>
          이제 너희, 하나, 둘, 셋<br>
          Ha, how you like that?<br>
          You gon' like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that<br>
          How you like that? (Bada-bing, bada-boom-boom-boom)<br>
          How you like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that?<br>
          Now look at you, now look at me, look at you, now look at me<br>
          Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?<br>
          Now look at you, now look at me, look at you, now look at me<br>
          Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?<br>
          날개 잃은 채로 추락했던 날<br>
          어두운 나날 속에 갇혀 있던 날<br>
          그때쯤에 넌 날 끝내야 했어<br>
          Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane<br>
          Yeah-eh-eh-eh<br>
          Bring out your boss, bitch<br>
          Yeah-eh-eh-eh<br>
          BLACKPINK!<br>
